# Introduction

Recent generations of the Intel® Xeon® family processors allow configurations
where Turbo Boost can be enabled on a per-core basis.

The script provided in this repository gives the user the ability to configure
the core frequencies (P-states), sleep states (C-states), and Turbo-Boost
capabilities of a core on a core by core basis.

# Overview

The scripts provided are as follows:

[power.py](power.md) is written in python, and allows the user
to adjust the frequencies and Turbo-Boost availability. This script also
allows command-line paramaters, allowing easy integration into other scripts
or cron jobs. This script allows the adjustment of P-states, C-states and
Turbo-Boost.

The script also provide a menu system for ease-of-use.
